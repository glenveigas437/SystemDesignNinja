# Getting Started with Design Patterns

In Software Enginnering, Design Patterns are highly essential, as they narrow down the commonly occurring problems in software design to one general solution that can be reused.

Mainly there are 3 types of design patterns
- Creational Design Patterns
- Structural Design Patterns
- Behavoiral Design Patterns

## 1) Creational Design Patterns
Creational as the name suggests means the process of creating some element. Creational Design Patterns deal with creation of classes and objects.
They're very useful for lowering the level of dependency between our classes and controlling how the user interacts with them as well.

Types of Creational Design Patterns
 - Factory Pattern
 - Abstract Factory Pattern
 - Builder Pattern
 - Prototype Pattern
 - Singleton Pattern


## 2) Structural Design Patterns
Structural Design Patterns are used to assemble multiple classes into bigger working structures.
They're very useful for creating readable, maintainable, layered code, especially when working with external libraries, legacy code, interdependent classes, or numerous objects.

Types of Structural Design Patterns
 - Adapter Pattern
 - Bridge Pattern
 - Composite Pattern
 - Decorator Pattern
 - Facade Pattern
 - Proxy Pattern
 - FlyWeight Pattern

## 3) Behavoiral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns are all about identifying the common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Types of Behavoiral Design Patterns
 - Chain of Responsibility Pattern
 - Command Pattern
 - Iterator Pattern
 - Mediator Pattern
 - Memento Pattern
 - Observer Pattern
 - State Pattern
 - Strategy Pattern
 - Template Pattern
 - Visitor Pattern


## Why Design Patterns?
- Code can be reused: By far the prime reason why we make use of design patterns, by making use of Inheritance we can use same blocks of code in different modules of different projects tooo.

- Promotes Transparency: Being Transparent helps a new developer to adapt and learn the functionalities of the code.
- Better Communication: Design patterns make communication between designers more efficient. Software professionals can immediately picture the high-level design in their heads when they refer the name of the pattern used to solve a particular issue when discussing system design.

- Efficient Development: Design patterns helps in the development of the highly cohesive modules with minimal coupling.
